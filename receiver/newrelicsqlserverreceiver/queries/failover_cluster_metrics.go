// Package queries provides SQL query definitions for failover cluster-level metrics.
// This file contains SQL queries for collecting SQL Server Always On Availability Group
// replica performance metrics when running in high availability failover cluster environments.
//
// Failover Cluster Metrics Categories:
//
// 1. Database Replica Performance Metrics:
//   - Log bytes received per second from primary replica
//   - Transaction delay on secondary replica
//   - Flow control time for log record processing
//
// Query Sources:
// - sys.dm_os_performance_counters: Always On Database Replica performance counters
//
// Metric Collection Strategy:
// - Uses PIVOT operation to transform performance counter rows into columns
// - Filters for Database Replica object counters specific to Always On Availability Groups
// - Returns structured data for log replication performance monitoring
// - Provides insights into replication lag and flow control behavior
//
// Engine Support:
// - Default: Full failover cluster metrics for SQL Server with Always On Availability Groups
// - AzureSQLDatabase: Not applicable (no Always On AG support in single database)
// - AzureSQLManagedInstance: Limited support (managed service handles AG internally)
//
// Availability:
// - Only available on SQL Server instances configured with Always On Availability Groups
// - Returns empty result set on instances without Always On AG enabled
// - Requires appropriate permissions to query performance counter DMVs

// FailoverClusterReplicaQuery returns the SQL query for Always On replica performance metrics
// This query uses GROUP BY approach to aggregate performance counter data by instance name
// Source: sys.dm_os_performance_counters for Database Replica performance counters
//
// The query returns:
// - instance_name: Database instance name from performance counters
// - Log Bytes Received/sec: Rate of log records received by secondary replica from primary (bytes/sec)
// - Transaction Delay: Average delay for transactions on the secondary replica (milliseconds)
// - Flow Control Time (ms/sec): Time spent in flow control by log records (milliseconds/sec)

// - last_sent_time: Timestamp when the last log block was sent
// - last_received_time: Timestamp when the last log block was received
// - last_hardened_time: Timestamp when the last log block was hardened
// - last_redone_lsn: Log sequence number of the last redone log record
